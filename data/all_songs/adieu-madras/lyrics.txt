Adieu Madras
Adieu Madras (Farewell Madras)
Though Stan Hugill noted the common dating of this song to the period of Louis-Philippe's rule (1830-1848), his suspicion that it was almost a hundred years older proved correct. It has been attributed to François Claude de Bouillé, governor of Guadalupe from 1769-1771.
The French and British wrestled over the Carnatic region (including Madras) of South India before it was eventually captured by the English and a favorable Indian prince was put in charge in 1750. The governor was slightly too young to have participated in this conflict.
In this song, a native girl tries to delay the sailing of her
matlow
(seaman) but it is too late to gain the necessary permit.

Farewell Madras, farewell neckerchiefs,
Goodbye silk clothes, goodbye collar, darling.
Sweetheart of mine - li ka pati,
Alas, alas, it is for ever!
Repeat last two lines in each verse
Good day - Governor!
I've come to make a petition,
For you to give me authorization,
So as to keep my sweetheart here.
No! no! no! no! It is too late,
The ship is ready at the buoy,
No! no! no! no! It is too late,
At this very moment she's ready to sail.
Farewell Madras, farwell neckerchiefs,
Goodbye beads of gold, goodbye collars, darling,
Sweetheart of mine - li ka pati,
Alas, alas, it is for ever!
