Away Rio
Away Rio
(Rio Grande)
Rio
should be pronounced "Rye-oh" and
Grande
should rhyme with sand.
According to Cecil Sharp,
English Folk-Chanteys
, "there is no better known or more popular chantey than Raio Grand which is included in nearly every Collection. The tune varies but little."

Oh say were you ever in Rio Grande?
Away, you Rio!
Oh say have you ever been down to that strand?
We are bound to the Rio Grande.
Chorus:
And a-way, boys away.
Away, you Rio!
And it's fare you well, my pretty young girls.
We are bound to the Rio Grande.
Oh, New York town it is no place for me;
I'll pack up my bags and I'll ship out to sea.
So it's goodbye to Kate and goodbye to Sue,
And them that's a-listening, its goodbye to you.
You Bowery ladies who live in this town,
We've left you sufficient to buy a silk gown.
Our good ship is going out over the bar,
And we'll point her prow towards the Southeastern Star.
