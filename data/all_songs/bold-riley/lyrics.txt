Goodbye, me darlin', goodbye, me dear-oh,
Ch:
Bold Riley-oh, boom-a-lay,
Goodbye, me darlin' goodbye, me dear-oh,
Ch:
Bold Riley-oh, gone away!
Our anchor's aweigh and our sails are all set,
Ch:
Bold Riley-oh, boom-a- lay!
And the folks we are leaving, we'll never forget,
Ch:
Bold Riley-oh, gone away!
Wake up Mary Ellen, and don't look so glum,
Ch:
Bold Riley-oh, boom-a- lay!
By Whitestocking time, you'll be drinking hot rum.
Ch:
Bold Riley-oh, gone away!
The rain it is raining now all the day long,
Ch:
Bold Riley-oh, boom-a- lay!
And the northerly wind, it does blow so strong.
Ch:
Bold Riley-oh, gone away!
We're outward and bound for Bengal bay,
Ch:
Bold Riley-oh, boom-a- lay!
Get bendin', me boys, it's a hell of a way.
Ch:
Bold Riley-oh, gone away!
