In Liverpool I was born,
Ch:
Bring 'em down,
London is me home from home,
Ch:
Bring 'em down.
In Liverpool I was bred,
Strong in the back and thick in the head.
Callao gals I do love so,
Waggle their arse with a roll and go.
Liverpool gals I do adore,
Rob yer blind and ask fer more.
When I git home from off the sea,

Bring 'em down it is the cry,
The bloody topmast sheave is dry.
Rock and roll her over boys,
Get this damned job over boys.
As sung by Danny Spooner
