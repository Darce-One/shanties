In Canso Strait our vessel lay:
We just arrived in from the Bay.
Our vessel built both stout and strong
To Gloucester she does belong.
We were homeward bound and ready for sea
When our drunken captain got on a spree.
He came on board and to us did say:
"Get your anchor, lads, and fill her away."
We filled her away at his command.
With all sails set we left the land,
Leaviny Sand Point all on our lee
As we sailed into a heavy sea.
The night came on and dark clouds lower;
The wind, did howl and breakers roar.
An angry squall and the angry sky
It put her down at half-mast high.
We kindly asked him to shorten sail
Or we'd all be lost in the heavy gale.
He turned and swore if the wind would blow
He'd show us how his boat could go:
"I am captain here and I will not fail
For to shoot the first man to touch a sail
Then up speaks one of our bravest men:
"There's nine of us right here at hand
"We'll reef her down and to sea we'll go,
If he interferes, lash him down below.
We'll reef her down to a steady steer
We're heading up the Cape Shore now
As she knocks the white foam from her bow.
Ouu jib-sheet tore, in the wind it flew;
We hauled it down and bent our new.
We were homeward bound with great success
Like some lonely seagull seeking rest.
When I get home no more I'll sail
With a drunken captain in a heavy gale.
