Can't They Dance the Polka
Can't They Dance the Polka
(Can't You Dance the Polka?; O You Santy)
The polka was introduced in Prague around 1835. By the 1840s, it was popular in Vienna, and by the 1850s, it had taken New York (as much of
the world) by storm. This song seems to show up first in Davis and Tozer's
Sailors' Songs or "Chanties"
, with some authors speculating that the duo composed most of the verses themselves. Gibb Sahib seems to have identified the source as the tune "Cynthia Sue" which was sung by Christy's Minstrels around 1844; "Santy" therefore would be the two-syllable version of "Cynthia".
The tune of this shanty may also come from the Irish tune "Larry Doolan." The reference to short-cut hair would seem to date the American sailor towards the end of the packet-ship days.
An almost identical tune, sometimes called "O You Santy", is:
As I was lumbering down the streets of bully London town,
I spied a Yankee clipper ship, to New York she was bound;
And hurrah, you Santy, my dear honey-
Hurrah, you Santy, I love you for your money.

Oh, once I loved a pretty girl
That I called Rosie mine,
Her cheeks were red, her hair did curl,
She was as straight as a line.
And away Rosie,
My own Ro'
Oh, my New York girls,
Can't you dance a polka?
She lived down in a little street
Close by the old clock tower;
And ev'ry eve we used to meet
And wander by the hour.
One night I went unto her house,
And knocked low at the door;
And heard my Rosie's little feet
A-tripping o'er the floor.
She ope'd the door and whispered low
"I can't come out tonight,
My father's here, you'd better go,
Oh! dear, I'm in a fright."
I said, "I'll not go off like this
So do not be afraid;
Just ope the door, give me a kiss,
Rosie, my pretty maid."
"Oh leave me quick, be off my dear
If you care for my life;
The man whose footsteps you now hear
Calls me his wedded wife."
And so I wandered quick away,
Before her husband came;
I thought unwise 'twould be to stay,
Not knowing Rosie's name.
I wedded then a New York girl
As true to me as steel;
She puts my brain quite in a whorl
So happy I do feel.
From
Sailors' Songs or "Chanties"
by Frederick J. Davis and Ferris Tozer (1886)
As I came down the Bowery
One evening in July
I met a maid who asked my trade
And a sailor John said I
Ch:
Then away, you Santy, my dear Annie,
Oh you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?
To Tiffany's I took her;
I did not mind expense.
I bought her two gold earrings,
They cost me fifteen cents.
She said, "If you're a sailor,
Now take me home you may,"
But when I reached her cottage door
She unto me did say:
"My young man he's a sailor,
With his hair cut short behind;
My young man he's a sailor,
And he sails in the Black Ball line."

Roll and Go
