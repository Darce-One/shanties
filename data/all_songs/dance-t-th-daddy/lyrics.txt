Come here me little Jackie
Now 've smoked me baccy
Have a bit o' crackie
'Till the boat comes in
Dance to ya daddy, sing to ya mammy
Dance to ya daddy, till ya mammy sings
Thou shall hev a fishy
on a little dishy,
Thou shall hev a fishy
when the boat comes in.
Here's thy mother humming,
Like a canny woman;
Yonder is ya father,
Drunk---he cannot stand.
Dance ti' thy daddy, sing ti' thy mammy,
Dance ti' thy daddy, ti' thy mammy sing;
Thou shall hev a fishy on a little dishy,
Thou shall hev a fishy when the boat comes in.
Our Tommy's always fuddled,
He's so fond of ale,
But he's kind to me,
I hope he'll never fail.
Thou shall hev a fishy on a little dishy,
Thou shall hev a fishy when the boat comes in
I like a drop mesel,
When I can get it sly
Though me bonnie bairn
Will lik't well as I
Thou shall hev a fishy on a little dishy,
Thou shall hev a fishy when the boat comes in
