Fire Down Below
Fire Down Below
(Fire! Fire!)
The joke, in Colcord's variant, lay in choosing non-flammable portions of the ship in which to locate his imaginary fire (except, of course, the cook's galley-- the kitchen always had its cooking fire).

There is fire in the lower hold, there's fire down below
Fire in the mainwell, the captain didn't know
Ch:
Fire! Fire!
Fire down below.
It's fetch a bucket of water, girls,
There's fire down below
!
There is fire in the fore-top, fire in the main,
Fire in the windlass and fire in the chain.
There is fire in the fore-peak, fire down below,
Fire in the chain-plates, the bosun didn't know.
There is fire up aloft, there's fire down below,
Fire in the galley, the cook he didn't know.
