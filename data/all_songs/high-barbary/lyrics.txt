There was two lofty ships, from old England they set sail
Ch:
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we!
The one she was the
Princess
and the other
Prince of Wales
Ch:
Cruising down along the shores of High Barbary!
"Lay aloft, lay aloft," our jolly skipper cried,
"Look ahead, look astern, look a-weather and a-lee,"
"There's nothing out ahead, sir, there's nothing out astern,
There's a rock upon our quarter and a ship upon our lee,"
"Now overhaul and speak her," our jolly skipper cried;
"Are you an India merchantman or Yankee privateer?"
"I am no India merchantman or Yankee privateer,
But I am & salt-sea pirate and I'm sailing for my fee."
'Twas broadside to broadside those gallant ships did lay,
Until the Prince of Wales shot the pirate's masts away.
For quarter, for quarter, the pirates they did cry,
But the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea.
From
Roll and Go
by Joanna Carver Colcord (1924)
