John Cherokee
(Alabama John Cherokee)
Another shanty with African-American roots, likely without nautical origin, that found use due to its "vigor and swing."
Temporarily disabled. Sorry. Please use the contact form in the sidebar.
John Cherokee was an Indian man
Ch:
Alabama, John Cherokee!
He runs away every time he can
Ch:
Alabama, John Cherokee!
Way-aye-yah!
Ugh
Ch:
Alabama, John Cherokee!
Way-aye-yah!
Ugh
Ch:
Alabama, John Cherokee!
They put him aboard a Yankee ship,
Again he gave the boss the slip.
They catch him again and chain him tight,
And starve him many days and nights.
He have nothing to drink and nothing to eat,
So he just gone dead at the boss's feet.
So they bury him by the old gate post,
And the day he died, you can see his ghost.
