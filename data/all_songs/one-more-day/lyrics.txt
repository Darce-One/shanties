One More Day
One More Day
This shanty is, according to Whall, another "homeward-bounder" typically reserved for the return home. John Short told Cecil Sharp it was always used as a capstan or windlass-shanty, but Bullen and Whall give it as a pulling-shanty, and Tozer as one for pumping.

Oh, have you heard the news, my Johnny?
Ch:
One more day!
We're homeward bound tomorrow
Ch:
One more day!
Only one more day, my Johnny
One more day!
Oh, rock and row me over,
One more day!
We're homeward bound to-morrow, Johnny,
We leave you without sorrow.
Can't you hear the old man snarling, Johnny ?
Can't you hear the capstan pawling?
Oh, heave and sight the anchor, Johnny,
Oh, heave and sight the anchor.
I'm bound away to leave you, Johnny,
But I will not deceive you.
From
Roll and Go
by Joanna Carver Colcord (1924)
Ch:
One more day, my Johnny,
One more day
O rock and roll me over
For one more day
There is one thing more that grieves me
Ch:
For one more day
There is my poor wife and baby
Ch:
For one more day.
I'm bound away to leave you
Ch:
For one more day
Don't let my parting grieve you
Ch:
For one more day.
From
English Folk-Chanteys
by Cecil Sharp (1914)
