Rolling Home
This song was usually sung aboard ships leaving Australia, though it was popular throughout the world. As usual, sailors would amend the country named in the chorus at will.

Call all hands to man the capstan
See the cable running clear
Heave away and with a will, boys
For new England we will steer
Ch:
Rolling home, rolling home
Rolling home across the sea
Rolling home to old New England
Rolling home dear land to thee
Fare you well, you Spanish maidens
It is time to say adieu
Happy times we've spent together
Happy times we've spent with you
"Round Cape Horn one frosty morning
And our sails were full of snow
Clear your sheets and sway your halyards
Swing her out and let her go
Up aloft amid the rigging
Blows a wild and rushing gale
Like a monsoon in the springtime
Filling out each well known sail
And the waves we leave behind us
Seem to murmur as they flow
There's a hearty welcome waiting
In the land to which you go
Many thousand miles behind us
Many thousand miles before
Ocean lifts her winds to bring us
To that well remembered shore
And we'll sing in joyful chorus
In the watches of the night
And we'll sight the shores of England
When the gray dawn brings the light.
...
Cheer up Jack, bright smiles await you
And her loving eyes will greet you
With kind welcomes everywhere.
