Sing Sally O
Sing Sally O
Colcord (
Roll and Go
) gives only the first version of this, and other, "negro
shanties", which seem to have originated in stowing cotton, but proved
useful aboard ships as well.

O I say my Mammy Dinah,
What is the matter?
Ch:
Sing Sally O; Fol-lol-de-day O hurrah hurrah!
Ch:
My Mammy Dinah, Sing Sally O; Fol-lol-de-day
O have you heard the news to-day?
For we are homeward bound.
From
English Folk-Chanteys
by Cecil Sharp (1914)
