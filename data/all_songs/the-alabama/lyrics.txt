The Alabama
(Roll, Alabama, Roll)
The melody here is a form of
Roll the Cotton Down
, as pointed out by Joanna Colcord.
The
Alabama
was a Confederate raider built in Birkenhead, England, on the river Mersey. In the Azores, she was quietly fitted with guns. For two years, she roamed the seas sinking and burning unarmed merchant ships.
In the summer of 1864, Captain Semmes docked at Cherbourg for repairs. The American minister in Paris reported her arrival and the U.S. Sloop of War
Kearsarge
under Captain Winslow met her outside the neutral French harbor. Crowds from Paris came to the cliffs and Southampton sportsmen brought their pleasure-yachts to witness the battle, which took place on the morning of Sunday, June 19, 1864. For forty minutes, the ships exchanged broadsides seven miles off the harbor. The
Alabama
sunk, and the British yacht
Deerhound
rescued captain Semmes and forty-one of his crew before the Northerners could get to them. Despite his treason and failure, Captain Semmes enjoyed a hero's welcome and military promotions upon arrival in England and his eventual return to the Confederate capital.
Harbor, NY. Maitland sang the first version consistently but would also
make up long, semi-extemporaneous verses as shown. Rhyme was preferred but not required.
On the stocks, prior to commissioning, she was known as "No. 290" - her number in the list of ships built by the Lairds.

When the Alabama's keel was laid,
Ch:
ROLL, Alabama, ROLL,
They laid her keel in Birkenhead,
Ch:
ROLL, Alabama, ROLL!
Oh, she was built at Birkenhead,
She was built in the yard of Jonathan Laird.
And down the Mersey she rolled away,
And Britain supplied her with men and guns.
And she sailed away in search of a prize.
And when she came to the port of Cherbourg,
It was there she met the little
Kearsarge
.
It was there she met the
Ke-arsarge
.
It was off Cherbourg harbor in April, '65,
That the
Alabama
went to a timely grave.

Songs of the Sailor and Lumberman

In eighteen hundred and sixty-one,
Ch:
Roll, Alabama, roll!
The
Alabama's
keel was laid,
Ch:
And Roll, Alabama, roll!
'Twas laid in the yard of Jonathan Laird,
At the town of Birkenhead.
At first she was called the "Two-Ninety-Two",
For the merchants of the city of Liverpool
Put up the money to build the ship,
In the hopes of driving the commerce from the sea.
Down the Mersey she sailed one day
To the port of Fayal in the Western Isles.
There she refitted with men and guns,
And sailed across the Western Sea
With orders to sink, burn and destroy
All ships belonging to the North.
Dick Maitland's version
