  "title": "The Bold Princess Royal",
  "notes": "Stan Hugill says this song dates from the 1600s-1700s, when the English Channel was infested with pirates and privateers. Joanna Colcord dates it to the American War for Independence or shortly before. The song has been especially popular on the eastern coast of England, though Alan Lomax collected it in Michigan in 1938 as part of the Irish-American folk repertoire."
