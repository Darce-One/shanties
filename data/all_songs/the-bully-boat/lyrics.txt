Ah the bully boat is coming
Don't you hear the paddles rolling?
Ch:
Rando, rando, hooray, hooray
Ah the bully boat is coming
Don't you hear the paddles rolling?
Ch:
Rando, rando, ray
Ah! the bully boat is coming,
Down the Mississippi floating.
As I walked out one May morning
To hear the steam-boat rolling.
From
English Folk-Chanteys
by Cecil Sharp (1914)
Well it's there I met a maiden
And with baskets she was laden.
Oh I'm bound away to leave you
And I never will deceive you.
When I come again to meet you
It's with kisses I will greet you.

Short Sharp Shanties, Vol. 2

We are bound for Valparais'er
With a load of rusty razors
Ch:
Ranzo, ranzo, a-ray, a-ray
We are bound for Venezuel'er
With this load of drunken tailors
Ch:
Hi-lo me Ranzo ray
We are bound for Santiag'a
With a load of German lager
We are bound for Buenos Aires
With a load of green canaries
We are bound for San Francisco
with a cargo load of piss gold
We are bound for Yokahana
With a load of grand pianos
We are homeward bound from China
On bound of a limey liner
We'll soon be seeing all them girls
The girls we do adore
We're loaded down with curios
from China and the Indias
We are puttin' on them longtail blues
to waltz them girls down
We sailed the whole world over
Like a proper deep-sea rover
We are passed cliffs of Dover
And soon we'll be in Clover
We'll eat and drink and have our fun
Says every drunken Johnny
Well them girls are waitin' at the pier
and soon they'll have our money
