The Constitution and Guerrière
This song describes the August 19 taking of the
Guerrière
by the U.S. frigate
Constitution
in 1812. It was published in the
Boston Gazette
on September 7, 1812. Colcord says her version follows the tune of "The Pretty Lass of Derby O!" but the
Gazette
names "Ye Mariners of England". For what it's worth, Colcord's version differs markedly from the original.
A British version with the same melody later commemorated the defeat of the
Chesapeake
by the
Shannon
(1813):

It ofttimes has been told
How the British seamen bold
Could flog the tars of France so neat and handy oh!
But they never found their match
Till the Yankees did them catch
Oh, the Yankee boys for fighting are the dandy-oh!
The Guerrière so bold,
On the foaming ocean rolled,
Commanded by proud Dacres the grandee, oh!
With as choice a British crew
As a rammer ever drew,
Could flog the Frenchmen two to one so handy, oh!
When this frigate hove in view,
Says proud Dacres to his crew,
"Come, clear ship for action and be handy, oh!
On the weather gage, boys, get her,"
And to make his men fight better,
He gave to them gunpowder mixed with brandy, oh!
Then Dacres loudly cries,
"Make this Yankee ship your prize,
You can in thirty minutes, neat and handy, oh!
Twenty-five's enough I'm sure,
And if you'll do it in a score,
I'll treat you to a double share of brandy, oh!"
The British shot flew hot,
Which the Yankees answered not,
Till they got within the distance they called handy, oh!
"Now," says Hull unto his crew,
"Boys, let's see what we can do,
If we take this boasting Briton we're the dandy, oh!"
The first broadside we poured
Took her mainmast by the board,
Which made this lofty frigate look abandon'd, oh!
Then Dacres shook his head;
To his officers he said,
"Lord! I didn't think those Yankees were so handy, oh!"
Our second told so well
That their fore and mizzen fell
Which dous'd the royal ensign neat and handy, oh!
"By Georgel" says he, "we're done,"
And they fired a lee gun,
While the Yankees struck up Yankee doodle dandy, oh!
Then Dacres came on board
To deliver up his sword,
Which he was loath to lose, it was so bandy, oh!
"Oh, keep your sword," says Hull,
"For it only makes you dull;
Cheer up and let us have a little brandy, oh!"
Now, fill your glasses full,
And we'll drink to Captain Hull,
And merrily we'll push about the brandy, oh!
John Bull may boast his fill,
But let the world say what it will,
The Yankee boys for fighting are the dandy, oh!
