As I came thro' Sandgate,
Thro' Sandgate, thro' Sandgate
As I came thro' Sandgate,
I heard a lassie sing:
Weel may the keel row,
The keel row, the keel row
Weel may the keel row
That my laddie's in.
Oh, wha's like my Johnnie,
Sae leish, sae blithe, sae bonny?
He's foremost 'mang the
Mony keel lads o' coaly Tyne.
Chorus
He'll set and row sae tightly,
Or in the dance sae sprightly
He'll cut and shuffle sightly
'tis true - were he not mine.
Chorus
He wears a blue bonnet,
Blue bonnet, blue bonnet
He wears a blue bonnet,
A dimple in his chin
Chorus
