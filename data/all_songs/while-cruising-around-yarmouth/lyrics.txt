While Cruising Around Yarmouth

While Cruising round Yarmouth one day for a spree,
I met a fair damsel - the wind blowing free.
I'm a fast going clipper - "my kind sir" said she,
"I'm ready for cargo my hold it is free.
"
Ch:
Singing fal the ral laddie right fal the ral day
fal the ral laddie right fal the ral day
What country she came from I could not tell such,
by her appearance I thought she was Dutch.
Her flag wore rich colours- her masthead was low,
She was round in the quarter and bluff at the bow.
I gave her the rope and I took her in tow,
We towed on together till we came to the head,
We both towed together through Trafalgary bay.
We towed on till we came to the House of Expire,
we gave her old horse with plenty of ire,
I lift up her hatches found plenty of room,
and into her cabin I stuck my jib- boom.
She took me upstairs and her topsails she lowered,
in a neat little parlour she soon had me moored,
She laid in her foresails her staysails and all,
with her lily white hand on my reef tackle fall.
I said pretty fair maid it's time to give o'er,
betwixt wind and water you've run me ashore.
My shot lockers empty and powders all spent,
I can't fire a shot cause it's choked at the vent.
Here's luck to the girl with the black curly locks,
Here's luck to the girl who run Jack on the rocks,
Here's luck to the doctor who eased all his pain,
He's squared his mainyards - he's a cruising again...
